          <h3>DATA BREACH SECURITY AND PROCEDURE</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              In the performing the Agreement and in relation to the processing of Personal Data,
              the Data Processor represents to have implemented the technical and organisational
              measures to ensure a level of security commensurate to the risk.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Data Processor represents that he or she has assessed the adequate level of
              security, considering the risks presented by the Processing activities which may arise
              from the destruction, loss, modification, unauthorised disclosure or access,
              accidentally or unlawfully, to personal data transmitted, stored or otherwise
              processed.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the Data Processor provides services from a location that is: (i) shared by one or
              more third party suppliers, or (ii) used to provide services to one or more third
              party customers, the Data Processor must limit access in any type of shared
              environment to the Personal Data related to the University in such a way that access
              to the data is prevented. The Data Processor must adequately separate and isolate all
              the University’s data from those of other third parties, and shall ensure that such
              data, records and information intended for data processing systems are not accessible
              to other third party clients.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Data Processor must not store and/or transfer Personal Data via any portable media
              (e.g. USB, disk or tape) unless the retention/transfer of such data has been
              previously authorised by the Data Controller in writing and such media are fully
              encrypted according to the most stringent technological standards. The Data Processor
              represents and warrants to the Data Controller that he or she has written procedures
              in place to follow in the event of a Data Breach or a security incident, which require
              a notice to the Data Controller. The Data Processor is liable for any Data Breach, in
              relation to the performance of this Data Processing Agreement – also in the case
              referred to under clause 15.1 – to the extent that such incident is not caused by the
              Data Controller.
            </li>
            <li>
              The Data Processor shall assist the Data Controller in ensuring compliance with the
              Personal Data security obligations set forth in Articles 32 to 36 of the Regulation,
              taking into account the nature of the Processing and the information available to the
              Data Processor. In case of a Personal Data breach, the Data Processor shall promptly
              inform the Data Controller as soon as it becomes aware of such breach, providing all
              available information and its support, including operational support, to allow the
              Data Controller to notify the Italian Data Protection Authority in accordance with the
              terms and conditions of Article 33 of the Regulation. In the event a Data Breach
              occurs, the Data Processor shall:
              <ol type="a">
                <li>
                  immediately provide, and in any case no later than 24 (twenty-four) hours after

                  re-occurring and provide a copy of such amendments to the Data Controller for
                  approval.
                </li>
              </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
              The Data Processor shall also keep the Data Controller constantly informed about all
              assessments and action plans undertaken in response to any security issue concerning
              Personal Data.
            </li>
            <li>

          <h3>NO ASSIGNMENT OF THE AGREEMENT AND THE RULES GOVERNING THE SUB-PROCESSORS</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>
              The Data Processor shall be provided a general authorisation to sub-contract the
              processing of Personal Data to Sub-Data Processors. The Data Processors may rely on
              another data processor (“Sub-Processor”) to perform specific Processing activities on
              behalf of the Data Controller, among those activities indicated in the Agreement, only
              if such is rendered necessary due to technical needs, specialisation or to meet the
              stipulated deadlines or to meet the quality of service and provided that the following
              conditions are met: the Data Processor shall enter into an agreement with each
              Sub-Processor which contain the same data protection obligations as those included in
              this Data Processing Agreement, specifically through mandating sufficient safeguards
              to ensure the Sub-Processor sets up technical and organisational measures such that
              the Processing complies with the Regulation and this Data Processing Agreement and, at
              the time of the authorisation request, the Data Processor must be accountable to the
              Data Controller by demonstrating it has conducted due diligence on the Sub-Processor
              to ensure that the same is compliant with the Regulation and is able to comply with
              the security obligations under clause 10 of this Data Processing Agreement;
            </li>
            <li>
              If the Data Processor appoints Sub-Processors that are located outside the European
              Union, the Data Processor must (1) assess whether such Sub-Processors have sufficient
              safeguards to set up technical and organisational measures that are suitable for the
              risk level, and (2) comply with Articles 44-50 of the Regulation. In its authorisation
              request to the Data Controller for a Sub-Processor, the Data Processor shall state the
              third country and the international organisation to which data shall be transferred
              and attach the appropriate safeguards (e.g. the clauses of the agreement entered into
              with the Sub-Processor).
            </li>
            <li>
              It is understood that if the Data Processor entrusts third parties, in part or in
              whole, with the Processing activities subject to this Data Processing Agreement, in a
              manner that does not comply with the one or more of the above requirements, such
              conduct shall be deemed a justifiable cause to terminate the contractual relationship
              with the Data Processor under the Agreement and the Data Processing Agreement,
              effective immediately.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the Sub-Processor fails to comply with any of its obligations relating to the
              protection of Personal Data, the Data Processor shall be fully liable to the Data
              Controller for the breaches of these obligations.
            </li>
